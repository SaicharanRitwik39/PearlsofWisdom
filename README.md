The Thirukkural, composed over 2,000 years ago, is one of the most significant and timeless works of Tamil literature. Written in a classical form of Tamil, it consists of 1,330 couplets systematically organized into 133 chapters, with each chapter containing 10 couplets. The couplets are divided into three parts: Virtue (Aram), Wealth (Porul), and Love (Inbam), covering various aspects of life, including ethics, statecraft, and human relationships.

The quotes are extracted from the Thirukkural, and I hope to add more as I explore this remarkable work further. My idea is to add 3-4 quotes everyday till I finish reading the entire book by myself.
